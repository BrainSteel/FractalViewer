# FractalViewer

## Created by Jesse Pritchard

### Made with SDL 2.0

On opening, the Mandelbrot set is displayed.  
View the Julia set corresponding to any point on the Mandelbrot set by clicking on the desired point.  
Return to the Mandelbrot set by clicking again.  

Press Z to zoom in to the cursor position.  
Press O to zoom out, back to the original position.  
Press L to toggle logarithmic coloring.  

Mouse input:
Click near the top of the screen to display an overlay reading "F Z O L".  
Click "F" to enter "Fractal Mode." While displaying the Mandelbrot set, clicking a location
while in fractal mode will display the Julia set for that location. While displaying a Julia set,
clicking any location will revert to the Mandelbrot set.

Click "Z" to enter "Zoom Mode." While displaying either fractal, clicking a location while in
zoom mode will display the same set, zoomed into the location clicked.

Click "O" to zoom all the way out of the current fractal.

Click "L" to toggle logarithmic coloring.
